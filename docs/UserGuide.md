## Quick start

1. **Install Java**: Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer. You can download the correct [JDK](#glossary) for your [operating system](#glossary) using this [link](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/).<br>
   **Mac users**: Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

2. **Download Tutorly**: Get the latest [JAR](#glossary) file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/releases/latest/download/tutorly.jar).

3. **Move the file**: Locate the downloaded `tutorly.jar` file and place it in a folder where you want to keep the app's data. This will be the app's _home folder_.

4. **Open a [command terminal](#glossary)** - This is a tool that lets you run commands on your computer:
   - On **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press **Enter**.
   - On **Mac**: Open **Terminal** from the Applications > Utilities folder.
   - On **Linux**: Open **Terminal** from your applications menu.

5. **Navigate to the folder**: In the terminal, type `cd ` (with a space after). Then, **click and hold** the _home folder_, **drag** it into the terminal window and **release** it. Doing this will automatically insert the full path of the folder. Press **Enter**.

6. **Run Tutorly**: Type `java -jar tutorly.jar` and press **Enter**. This will start the application. A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds, containing some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

7. **Execute a command**: Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `student list` : Lists all students.

   * `student add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a student named `John Doe` to the app.

   * `student delete 3` : Deletes the student with the ID 3.

   * `session list` : List all sessions.

   * `clear` : Deletes all students and sessions.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

8. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#glossary) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `student add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `student add n/John Doe`.

* [STUDENT_IDENTIFIER](#glossary) can either be the target student's ID, or their full name. Examples: `John Doe` or `2`.

* Parameters in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra parameters for commands that do not take in parameters ([general](#general-commands) commands, `student list` and `session list`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123` or `session list blah`, it will be interpreted as `help` and `session list`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

Tutorly data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Tutorly data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[home_folder]/data/tutorly.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Tutorly will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the Tutorly to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Tutorly _home folder_.

**Q**: What is the difference between the `student list` and `student` commands?<br>
**A**: The `student list` command will list all students in Tutorly. The `student` command simply switches the active tab to students and preserves results from any previous `student search` commands. The same applies to `session` and `session list`. 

**Q**: What is the difference between the `memo` and `feedback`?<br>
**A**: `Memo` is a short note you can add on to a student's details, while `feedback` is specifically for a student's performance in a particular session.

**Q**: How should I fill in the `STUDENT_IDENTIFIER` parameter?<br>
**A**: The `STUDENT_IDENTIFIER` can either be the student's ID or their full name, both of which are viewable from the UI.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
